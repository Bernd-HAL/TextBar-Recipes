## Recipies

### What is my Local IP address?
    ipconfig getifaddr en0

### What is my external IP address?
    curl http://ipinfo.io/ip

### How much disk space am I using?
    df / | awk '{ print $5 }' | tail -n 1

### What is the time in a different country (e.g. UK)?
    UKDATE=\`TZ=GB date +"%H:%M %p"\` ; echo "UK: $UKDATE"

### Is my website running?
    ALIVE=\`curl -Is www.google.com | grep -q "200 OK"\` && echo "Google Alive" || echo "Google Dead"

### Smiley
    echo 'ðŸ˜€'
> Easiest way to see other emoji is; Open TextEdit, then "Edit > Emoji & Symbols". Then just copy and paste into TextBar.

### What is my battery charge?
    ioreg -n AppleSmartBattery -r | awk '$1~/Capacity/{c[$1]=$3} END{OFMT="%.2f%%"; max=c["\"MaxCapacity\""]; print (max>0? 100*c["\"CurrentCapacity\""]/max: "?")}'

### What song (and album) is playing in iTunes?
    TRACK=\`osascript -e 'tell application "iTunes"' -e 'set currentTrackName to "[OFF]"' -e 'if player state is playing then' -e 'set currentTrackName to get name of current track & " [" & album of current track & "]"' -e 'end if' -e 'return currentTrackName' -e 'end tell'\` ; echo "> $TRACK"
> This isn't ideal, as it'll launch iTunes if it isn't running. It should really check if iTunes is running before using the AppleScript. Let me know if you have a better solution.
    
### Unicode Weather
    curl weather.mar.cx/Manchester,_UK | grep "<title>" | cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1
> This is likely to break as it isn't entirely robust. Edit the location to get your weather.

### Unread Emails in Outlook
    osascript $HOME/scripts/CheckOutlookMail.scpt
> Download CheckOutlookMail.scpt to your machine (to ~/scripts), and then add this to TextBar.

### Show the clipboard (text)
    pbpaste | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]$//' | sed -E 's/^(.{10}).+$/\1.../'
> This looks more complex than you might imagine. It; strips leading and trailing whitespace, displays only 10 chars (and if it exceeds 10 characters, it'll display the ellipsis).
> Obviously, if you 'Copy to Clipboard' on this, you'll get the truncated text - but, as it is already on the clipboard, you don't need to copy it :-).

### Character Count of current clipboard
    pbpaste | wc -c
